# Robot Swarm

In this project I will be creating a C++ class, and an object of that class. Classes can be used to represent anything: cars, gradebooks, students, professors, or in this case, robots. For this project, I will create the class Robot. However, one robot by itself is not very interesting so I will also create a class called RobotSwarm that will manage a group of Robot objects, letting them move around within a grid without colliding with one another. As a final piece, I will also maintain a record of each Robot object’s “history” – the locations it touched on the grid and the number of times it touched the points on the grid. I will write this history out to a file for each Robot.

**The learning objectives of this project**:
1. Using basic C++ classes;
2. Creating basic vectors of user-defined objects;
3. Creating constructors and overloading constructors;
4. Using and creating set and get member functions in C++ classes;
5. Using C++ string objects;
6. Using basic text file I/O objects.
